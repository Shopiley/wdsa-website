## Founder's Letter

Hi!

Thank you for considering becoming a volunteer for this program!

In 2021, I taught 2 sets of people (7 in total) the internals of data structures and how to use specific algorithms over 5- and 7- weeks. In those weeks, we reviewed the structures in [this repo](https://github.com/oyekanmiayo/data-structures-all-langs) and solved questions from Leetcode and other sources. The schedule was like this: teach theory at the weekends, and have 1:1s throughout the week to answer each person’s questions/address specific challenges. Personalised learning was helpful as everyone faced different challenges. And the results were great: 6 out of 7 got new offers from companies like Bloomberg, Microsoft and Amazon.

In 2022, we officially announced Wolfstation DSA program and taught over 200 people with the help of amazing volunteers over the course of x weeks. The results? offers from Bloomberg, Goldman Sachs and Bank of America.

**Our goal with this program is to equip software engineers with a strong foundation in data structures and algorithms (DSAs) to not only succeed in technical interviews but also excel in their software engineering careers.**

The high-level plan is as follows

- Follow this [DSA Plan](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vsvKu85kwHSo4Qtg8u2EU4Hwz2mzKrRgVefm2B22ysw/edit?usp=sharing). The modules we’ll teach will mostly follow the order stipulated in that plan.
- Every module will include at least 2 classes (over 1 or 2 weeks)
    - The first class will be to teach theory using [this repo](https://github.com/oyekanmiayo/data-structures-all-langs).
      - Each tutor will need to go over the internals of each data structure carefully and will need to walk through a sample implementation of said structure.
      - Each tutor should also aim to discuss techniques frequently associated with their structure. For example, “two pointers” is associated with strings, arrays and linked lists; depth- and breadth-first searches are associated with trees and graphs.
    - The second class will be to solve questions and answer questions people have. There will be many questions since the class size will be large, so we can use apps that allow “upvoting” questions.
- Optionally, each tutor can create a Typeform-style test to examine the cohort’s knowledge.
- As each structure is taught, problems are solved, and questions are answered, tutors should emphasise big-O and problem-solving steps.
- We’ll pair volunteers randomly for mock interviews to show members of the cohorts how interviews can go.

I hope that many people volunteer for this program (and future ones) because it will mean that each person has less to focus on (i.e. a max of one or two topics). Having less to focus on means each person will have a minimal time commitment and, more importantly, be able to prepare for their modules excellently.

If you’ve gotten to this portion of the message: thank you for sticking through. I’d like to ask now that you go through the modules (and their dates) and let me know which one(s) you’re interested in taking. After each module’s volunteer is confirmed, I’ll follow up with next steps. If you put your name on a module, I’ll take that as your confirmation and add you to our discord server.

One final note: if you cannot take a module for any reason (life happens), we ask that you kindly let us know as soon as possible to make it possible to make alternate plans.

Thank you again; the Wolfstation DSA Program 3.0 would not be possible without you. We’re excited about the process and outcome; we think we will change people’s lives.

Sincerely,

Ayomide Oyekanmi

Founder, Wolfstation DSA Program
