Hi! Thank you for your interest in this program!

In 2021, I taught 2 sets of people (7 in total) the internals of data structures and how to use specific algorithms over 5- and 7- weeks. In those weeks, we reviewed the structures in [this repo](https://github.com/oyekanmiayo/data-structures-all-langs) and solved questions from Leetcode and other sources. The schedule was like this: teach theory at the weekends, and have 1:1s throughout the week to answer each person’s questions/address specific challenges. Personalised learning was helpful as everyone faced different challenges. And the results were great: 6 out of 7 got new offers from companies like Bloomberg, Microsoft and Amazon.

In 2022, we officially announced Wolfstation DSA program and taught over 200 people with the help of amazing volunteers over the course of x weeks. The results? offers from Bloomberg, Goldman Sachs and Bank of America.

**Our goal with this program is to equip software engineers with a strong foundation in data structures and algorithms (DSAs) to not only succeed in technical interviews but also excel in their software engineering careers.**

Thank you again; the Wolfstation DSA Program 3.0 would not be possible without you. We’re excited about the process and outcome; we think we will change people’s lives.

Sincerely,

Ayomide Oyekanmi
